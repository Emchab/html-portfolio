<h1>The Best Movies According to Emmanuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This is my introduction to Christopher Nolan's Batman. I watched this first because I had no interest in
 Batman Begins before.</p>
<h3>Fast Five</h3>
<p>This movie got me rewatching all of the fast & furious series from the start.</p>
<h3>A Walk To Remember</h3>
<p>A tear jerker movie.</p>
